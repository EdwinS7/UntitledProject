# Introduction
Our Game Engine is a project aimed at providing developers with a simple yet powerful game development tool. The engine is designed to be extremely lightweight, making it suitable for various types of games, from simple 2D games to more complex high-definition 3d projects.

# Features
* **Lightweight and Efficient:** Designed to minimize overhead and maximize performance.
* **Comprehensive Lua API:** Full Lua scripting support for game logic and customization.
* **Modular Design:** Easy to extend and customize with additional modules.
* **Upcoming Features:**
* **Map Editor:** A user-friendly interface for creating and editing game maps.
* **Script Editor UI:** An integrated environment for writing and debugging Lua scripts.

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lightweight-game-engine.git`

# Building
* **Only supported by MSVC at the moment!**

# Usage
Once you have installed the engine and successfully built it, you can start creating your game. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to set up a basic game using the [Lua API](https://edwn.gitbook.io/documentation/):
```lua
Graphics.SetClearColor(Color.new(0, 0, 0, 255)) --Demo made by @Splatzy

local DefaultFont = Renderer.CreateFont( "Segoe UI", 16, 400, Vector2.new( 0, 0 ), false)

local ASCII = [[
    ,'\
    _.----.        ____         ,'  _\   ___    ___     ____
_,-'       `.     |    |  /`.   \,-'    |   \  /   |   |    \  |`.
\      __    \    '-.  | /   `.  ___    |    \/    |   '-.   \ |  |

      \    \ \      /       `-.`.___,-' |  |\  /| \      /  | |   |

                                `'                            '-._|
]]
    
function Interface ()   
	Renderer.Text(DefaultFont, ASCII, Vector2.new(5, 5), Color.new(204, 53, 53,255))
end

AddCallback("OnInterfacePaint", Interface)
